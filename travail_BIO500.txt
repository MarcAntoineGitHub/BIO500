Threats to global freshwater biodiversity fall into five categories: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences on biodiversity are now worldwide, and are exacerbated further by global-scale environmental changes such as nitrogen deposition and climate change. Knowledge of these threats is increasing among scientists but is insufficiently incorporated within water-resource development, and thus requires wider dissemination and emphasis.
